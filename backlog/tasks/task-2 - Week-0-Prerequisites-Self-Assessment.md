## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Pre-Week 1 preparation. Validate readiness for AI Architect sprint by assessing knowledge gaps and completing targeted prep based on your background.

**Self-Assessment (5 min):**
Answer these 5 questions honestly to determine your path:
1. Do you know why cosine similarity is used for text, not Euclidean distance?
2. Can you sketch the 4 stages of RAG (ingest → chunk → embed → retrieve → generate)?
3. What's a token? Why does context window matter?
4. What is prompt injection? Why does it matter for RAG?
5. Have you used experiment tracking (MLflow, Weights & Biases)?

**Scoring:**
- 5 YES → Path A: Skip prep, start Week 1 Monday
- 3–4 YES → Path C: 3-day focused prep (Mon/Tue/Wed)
- 1–2 YES → Path B: 1-week relaxed prep (30 min/day)
- 0 YES → Full prerequisite checklist (section by section)

**Key Topics to Master:**
- Tokens & context windows
- Embeddings & vector similarity (cosine vs Euclidean)
- RAG pipeline architecture
- Prompt injection & safety
- MLflow experiment tracking

**Success Criteria:**
- Can explain RAG in 2 minutes
- Can compute cosine similarity
- Understand why context window matters
- Can sketch RAG pipeline
- Know what MLflow does

**Time Budget:** 0 hours (Path A) to 12 hours (Full prep)
