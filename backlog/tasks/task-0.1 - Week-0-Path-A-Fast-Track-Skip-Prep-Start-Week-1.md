## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
For developers scoring 5/5 on self-assessment.

**What to do:**
- Skip detailed prep
- Week 1 Day 1 covers learning + building simultaneously
- Fill gaps just-in-time as you encounter them
- Re-read resources if needed mid-implementation (expected and OK)

**Minimal Learning (30 min before Monday):**
- Play with [OpenAI Tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) (10 min)
- Skim [Pinecone Vector DB 101](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-database/) (15 min)
- Read [LlamaIndex RAG Concepts](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/getting_started/concepts/) (5 min)

**Risk:** May need to pause and re-read during Week 1 (acceptable)
**Benefit:** Immediate momentum, learn-by-building mindset

**When to start:** Monday morning, Week 1 Day 1
